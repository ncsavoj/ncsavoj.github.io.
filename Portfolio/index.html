      <p>This website will give you an in depth look into my life and what has lead me to teach<br>
         myself web development in order to change careers into a more creative, ever-changing field that<br>
         better fits my interests and abilities.
      </p>
      <p>I am using this website first and foremost to showcase what I have learned thus far.  Although in<br>
         its present state I know the website is far from a shining jewel of the internet, the current build<br>
         has been done after only two weeks of coding experience.  I hope to greatly enhance and build from<br>
         this basic platform as time goes on and my skills improve.</p>
      <p>More than just a portfolio, this site will be an all encompasing encyclopedia about me.  As I build<br>
        a library of projects they will be added to this site but for now it serves mostly as a bio, resume,<br>
        and blog to give anyone considering taking me on as a junior web developer a better idea of who I am<br>
        as well as my current abilities in front-end web development.
