        <p>Currently I am employed by Staff Electric Company as a 2nd year <strong>inside-wireman apprentice</strong>.<br>
         Daily tasks include installing fixtures and devices such as lights and electrical outlets,<br>
         mounting electrical panels, running conduit, pulling wire, and terminating wire properly into whatever<br>
         it is feeding</p>
         <p>This work requires the ability to pay close attention to detail.  Everything must be done<br>
            in a timely manner to meet deadlines. Most projects are done by a team of electricians which<br>
            has given me a lot of experience coordinating and communicating progress, goals, and a daily<br>
            plan of action with my fellow coworkers.</p>
         <p>Some of the things I enjoy about this job are the opportunities to create.  Every day at the<br>
           end of my shift I can visibly see my progress.  Problem solving and the ability to think outside<br>
           of the box often come into play as well.</p>

        <p>Prior to my apprenticeship I was employed by the State of Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections as a<br>
        <strong>Correctional Officer</strong>(CO).</p>
        <p>Being a CO requires an individual to have a very acute sense of detail.  You quickly pick up on the<br>
        ability to notice anything out of place.  Inmates have a lot of time and experience when it comes to<br>
        hiding things from Officers.  Cell searches are a very high risk game of cat and mouse constantly<br>
        testing your abilities.</p>
        <p>Documentation and the ability to relay information to your fellow officers is also a big part of<br>
        working in corrections.  Everything gets recorded, from the times daily activities occur to any inmate<br>
        activity that appears to be abnormal.  If an inmate that is usually very active and outgoing does not<br>
        come out of his cell during dayroom(a time when inmates a free to hang out in the rec areas of the unit)<br>
        it gets recorded.  Passing this information on to the oncoming shift is vital for the safety of everyone.</p>

        <img style="clear: left; float: left;" src="https://i.imgur.com/pRUCT1s.jpg" alt="EMS Symbol" width="500px" height="500px">
        <p>Shortly after leaving the USMC I got my EMT-B license.  From there I took a job as an <strong>EMT-B</strong><br>
        with Paratech Ambulance Services.  I operated as part of a two or three man crew providing basic life<br>
        support medical interventions as well as transportation for the city of Milwaukee, WI.  We worked<br>
        together with the Milwaukee Fire Dept. to respond to medical emergencies.</p>
        <p>Working as an EMT brings you very close to your coworkers.  The joke in the field is that the<br>
          closer resembles a marriage than anything else.  This profession will really teach you what it means<br>
          to work as a team.</p>
        <p>The situations you are presented with are endlessly variable.  You need to be able to analyze each<br>
          patients symptoms quickly and decide on a course of treatment.  A good team will have a clear chain<br>
          of command and very rapidly agree upon a course of action.</p>
